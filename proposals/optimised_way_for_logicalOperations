Hey Team Swift,

Some times we have code like as following
if indexPath.row == 1 || indexPath.row == 3 || indexPath.row == 6
{
    //do something
   //although we can acheive same using switch with optimised way
   //But one suggestion for situations like this
}

//Suggesion in case of OR Operator
if indexPath.row == ||(1, 3, 6)
{
    //do something
}

//Suggesion in case of AND Operator
if indexPath.row == &&(1, 3, 6)
{
    //do something
}

Thanks
